Create a URL shortener library (e.g., bitly). Given a long URL, your program should return a
shortened URL. Ensure the following:

a. for a long URL X, your program should always return the shortened URL x

b. the short URLs your program returns, must not follow any pattern; successive calls to
your program should return very different short URLs 

c. for two different long URLs X and Y, your program should (ideally) always return two
different shortened URLs x and y

d. your program must be able to accept long URLs provided both through console as well
as from a file of newline separated long URLs

e. the program should work for input files with up to 100000 URLs without crashing
